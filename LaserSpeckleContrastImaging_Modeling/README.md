Part of a project in Physiological Modeling where i modeled a Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) system.
Report from project is in Report_Noise_in_laser_speckle_contrast_imagining.pdf

Main files

specklemodelbrownian.m - Models blood moving in capillaries with brownian motion, models the resulting Laser Speckle image generated using the imaging system.

intensityvcontrast.m - calculates and plots intensity and contrast for different types of bloodflow imaged using LSCI

shotnoisevcontrast.m - calculates and plots resulting contrast in LSCI images based on amount of noise in camerasystem and different types of blood flow.

Data folder contains data used by the main files

functions folder contains all the funtions used to make calculations of contrast, intensity, noise etc. as well as plot results
